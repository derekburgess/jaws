      # This uses the host systems JAWS_FINDER_ENDPOINT, but mounts it to the container's /home directory
      # This allows the files created by the container to be downloaded to the host system


# To enter a bash shell in the jaws container, run the following command:
# docker ps
# docker exec -it <container_id> bash

# Download the Hugging Face models first by running: jaws-anchor --model "all"
